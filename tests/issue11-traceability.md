# Issue #11 traceability ledger

Tracks every review requirement for PR #13 (Phase 3) and PR #14 (Phase 2):
where it was implemented (commit) and how it was proven (test IDs, result).
Not part of any PR. Raw outputs live in `tests/results/` as
`phase{2,3}-S<step>-<timestamp>.txt`.

Test host: WSL Ubuntu-26.04, KVM, 3 UEFI nodes (main, secondary, secondary-1).
Upgrade baselines: `v1.1.2` (release, transient nodes + dnsmasq), `origin/main` (`1fc2922`).

## PR #13 - Phase 3, declarative VM lifecycle

Branch `feat/11-phase3-vm-template-units`, base `origin/main` `1fc2922`.
Pre-existing commits: `81c2c90` (template units), `5cde6e0` (man page).

| Req | Requirement | Step | Commit | Tests | Result |
|-----|-------------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| R0-3 | `del_nat` must not end cleanup early | S3.1 | `676603b` | T3.8 | PASS |
| R0-1 | Every wait is bounded | S3.2 | `825810b` | T3.H | PASS |
| R0-2 | Helpers never touch caller traps | S3.2 | `825810b` | T3.H | PASS |
| R13-1 | Keep `BindsTo=aos-unit.service` | S3.3 | `21fc40b` | T3.1, T3.2 | PASS (S3.8 regression) |
| R13-2 | Remove `After=aos-unit.service` | S3.3 | `21fc40b` | T3.1, T3.2 | PASS (S3.8 regression) |
| R13-3 | Runner owns node-start gate | S3.3 | `21fc40b` | T3.3 | PASS (S3.8 regression) |
| R13-4 | Template conditions, `-` env files, ExecCondition | S3.3 | `21fc40b` | T3.1, T3.2, T3.3 | PASS (S3.8 regression) |
| R13-5 | Transient dnsmasq untouched, no After=dnsmasq | S3.8 audit | n/a | A3.1 | PASS: `git diff 1fc2922 e0051aa` has no dnsmasq/systemd-run lines; `node@` has no `After=` |
| R13-6 | Keep vm-launch, env files, set-property | S3.8 audit | `81c2c90` | T3.1 limits | PASS (cgroup limits in T3.1) |
| R13-7 | Static cleanup by ActiveState only | S3.4 | `32c4494` | T3.5 | PASS (S3.8 regression) |
| R13-8 | Migrate legacy `aos-unit-node-*` transient units | S3.5 | `8f0739c` | T3.6 | PASS (reruns from v1.1.2 and main) |
| R13-9 | Restart policy decided by failure matrix | S3.6 | `57f2627` (tag), `1556cd1` (decision) | T3.4 | PASS: on-failure kept; teardown identical under both policies thanks to the gate, on-failure also retries exit-code/OOM/ExecStartPre failures up to StartLimitBurst |
| R13-10 | Network orchestration otherwise unchanged | S3.8 audit | n/a | A3.1 | PASS: only `network-helper` cleanup (bounded node wait, gate, `del_nat`) and `runner` changed; `service-startup`, `service-cleanup`, `aos-unit.service` identical to main |
| (pkg) | No maintscript start/stop for `aos-unit-node@` | S3.8 | n/a | T3.7 | PASS (maintscripts name `aos-unit.service`, `aos-unit.slice` only; `dpkg -r` while running is clean) |
| (docs) | Gated lifecycle in README / man / polkit | S3.7 | `e0051aa` | `man --warnings` | PASS |

## PR #14 - Phase 2, declarative network sidecar

Rework branch `feat/11-phase2-rework`, stacked on PR #13 head `e0051aa`.
It replaces PR #14's branch `feat/11-phase2-dnsmasq-static-unit` at publish
time (published head on the fork `cb28236`; unpublished local rewrite
`0c23da8` + `12d42a0` left untouched; `cb28236` and `0c23da8` differ only in
README/man wording). Commits:
`dcb611e` (static unit, port of `0c23da8`), `950e70d` (S2.1), `d5d74de` (S2.2),
`4d06c73` (S2.3), `370e4cf` (S2.4), `79990ec` (S2.5), `7bf97eb` (S2.6 docs).

| Req | Requirement | Step | Commit | Tests | Result |
|-----|-------------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| R14-1 | No `PropagatesStopTo=`; cleanup owns dnsmasq stop | S2.1 | `950e70d` | T2.1, T2.2 | PASS (restart x2 gives a new dnsmasq PID each time; stop is clean) |
| R14-2 | Teardown order nodes -> dnsmasq -> network | S2.1 | `950e70d` | T2.2 | PASS (journal anchors; also with a SIGSTOPped guest: dnsmasq stays active ~58 s until it is killed) |
| R14-7 | Node delta only `After=` the sidecar (see D-1) | S2.2 | `d5d74de`, `4d06c73` | T2.1, T3.1 | PASS |
| R14-3 | Transient -> static dnsmasq migration, bounded | S2.3 | `4d06c73` | T2.3 | PASS: lingering legacy migrated on first start; stuck legacy fails start after 31 s (15 s + 15 s cleanup), self-heals |
| R14-4 | Real upgrade: first start OK, `Transient=no` | S2.3 | `4d06c73` | T2.3 | PASS from Phase 3 deb (migration fired, no manager restart) and from v1.1.2 (F-1 self-heal only) |
| R14-5 | Debian manages only `aos-unit.service` | S2.4 | `370e4cf` | T2.4 | PASS (maintscripts name only `aos-unit.service`; `dpkg -r` while running is clean) |
| R14-6 | `dpkg-deb -e` grep finds no dnsmasq actions | S2.4 | `370e4cf` | T2.4 | before: `prerm`/`postinst` stop/restart `aos-unit-dns.service` + `aos-unit.slice` at `4d06c73`; after: only `aos-unit.service` (`inspect-maintscripts.sh`) |
| R14-8 | Drop remaining transient machinery | S2.5 | `79990ec` | T2.5 | PASS at `79990ec` (SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, port taken, leftover failed: each ends in a clean stop and a clean next start). At `7bf97eb` T2.5c (port taken) ended with `aos-unit.service` failed in 2 of 2 runs: F-2, runner exit 143; teardown complete and the next start clean. `runner` is identical in both builds. |
| (docs) | Sidecar ownership, order, new name | S2.6 | `7bf97eb` | `man --warnings` | PASS |

### Deviations

| ID | Deviation | Why | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-----|----------|
| D-1 | The static sidecar ships as `aos-unit-dns.service`, not under the transient name `aos-unit-dnsmasq.service`. Migration follows the review's rule unchanged: stop the transient `aos-unit-dnsmasq`, wait for `LoadState=not-found`, start the static unit. | `debhelper` runs `daemon-reload` while the old transient is still loaded, so systemd maps the name to the transient file; once collected, the name stays `not-found` until the next `daemon-reload`, which the `aos-unit` user cannot run. A same-name static unit fails its first start after every upgrade from a running transient release. User decision 2026-10-02. | `probe-transient-shadow.sh` |
| D-2 | `wait_for_unit_inactive` is used for the static sidecar; `wait_for_unit_unloaded` only for the legacy transient. | Static units never reach `not-found`. | T2.1, T2.2 |

## Test runs

| Step | Package | Tests | Result |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| S3.0 before | `5cde6e0` | T3.1 | FAIL (3): `Result: resources` / missing env file on every restart; proves the `After=`+`BindsTo=` race |

| S3.5 | `8f0739c` from main | T3.6 | migration checks PASS; harness FAILs (NRestarts reset by explicit restart, stop before guest boot); runner exit 143 once (see findings) |

| S3.8 | `e0051aa` from main | T3.6 | PASS |
| S3.8 | `e0051aa` from v1.1.2 | T3.6 | 1 FAIL = harness: F-1 signature did not allow the `(during manager stop)` tag added by `57f2627`; same 3 legacy guests as F-1 |

| S2.5 | `79990ec` | T2.1, T2.2, T2.5 | T2.5 PASS; 3 FAIL = harness: T2.2 read unit timestamps after GC (all 0), T2.1 restarted before guests booted (F-3) |
| S2.5 rerun | `79990ec` | T2.1, T2.2, T2.3a/b | PASS |
| S2.7 | `7bf97eb` | T2.1, T2.2, T2.3a/b, T2.5 | 2 FAIL in T2.5c = F-2 (runner exit 143 on a stop 4 s after the route monitor started; teardown itself correct and complete); everything else PASS |

| F-2 probe | `7bf97eb` | 8 x (start, 5 s, stop), no port holder | 0/8 exit 143 |

## Known journal noise (out of PR scope)

Journal lines seen while testing that are **not** R12/R13/R14 failures. Listed
separately so a scary log does not get read as “the PR broke this requirement.”
Some are real bugs on `main`; they are still out of scope for PR #13/#14 sign-off.

**Disposition:** `expected` = correct behaviour for the scenario; `fix-later` =
pre-existing product issue, file separately; `uninvestigated` = noted, not chased.

Harness knob `KNOWN_V112_SELF_HEAL=1` downgrades F-1 journal lines to `INFO`.

| ID | What we saw | Disposition | Why not a req fail | Seen in |
|----|-------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| F-1 | Upgrade from running v1.1.2: first new start fails `Bridge already exists`, second start OK (`DHCP_START` missing in old `network.conf`) | fix-later | Pre-existing on `main`; self-heals on restart | T3.6 upgrade from v1.1.2 |
| F-2 | Rare `runner` exit 143 after otherwise complete teardown (SIGTERM during route-monitor `read`) | fix-later | Pre-existing on `main`; teardown complete, next start clean | T2.5c; not reproduced by `probe-early-stop.sh` |
| F-3 | Stop before guests boot: nodes hit 60 s stop timeout and log `VM unit FAILED (during manager stop)` | expected | By design when stop races guest boot; scripts wait for guests first | T3.3 pre-test teardown |
| F-4 | DNS port taken: manager stays active while dnsmasq crash-loops | fix-later | Pre-existing on `main`; stop still tears down cleanly | T2.5c |
| F-5 | dnsmasq `duplicate dhcp-host` during teardown | uninvestigated | Not classified; may be harmless ordering noise | `probe-stop-journal.sh` |
